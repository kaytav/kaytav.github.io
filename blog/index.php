				<small>July 2nd, 2007 <!-- by Gilmore for President --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>SPRINGFIELD, VA – The presidential campaign of former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore announced today that Gilmore received emergency eye surgery Friday to repair a partially detached retina in his right eye.</p>
<p>The surgery, which was performed by Dr. Juan Astruc, Jr. at the  Retina Institute of Virginia in Richmond was successful and Gilmore is currently recuperating at home in Richmond.  “The emergency surgery went well and the Governor’s prognosis is good,” Dr. Astruc said Monday.</p>
<p>Gilmore spokesman Dick Leggitt said doctors had restricted Gilmore’s travels for an indefinite period of time and the campaign has cancelled its scheduled events for at least the next seven days.  “He is very anxious to get back to campaigning, but for the moment that is not possible,” Leggitt said.</p>

				<small>June 26th, 2007 <!-- by Gilmore for President --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>WASHINGTON – Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore today applauded U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana for calling for a change in U.S. policy in Iraq.  Gilmore took a similar action a week ago.  Both Lugar and Gilmore said President Bush’s Iraq strategy is not working and both of them called for a downsizing of American military force in Iraq.</p>
<p>“I applaud Senator Lugar for his courageous comments today on the Iraq situation and I know that his comments came from the heart, as did mine,” Gilmore said.  “We can do better.  We can refocus our efforts toward protecting our national interests and away from policing Iraq neighborhoods with our valiant young military men and women.”</p>
<p>Gilmore said he hoped that in “the coming weeks many other key Republicans will join Senator Lugar and I in working for a limited drawdown of American forces in Iraq and redeployment geared to protecting the United States’ national interest and national security.”</p>
<p>Lugar said in his statement, “I suspect that for some Americans, benchmarks are a means of justifying a withdrawal by demonstrating that Iraq is irredeemable.” Gilmore in his letter to President Bush on June 16 made a similar comment, “Worst of all, we are starting to suggest that we will define “benchmarks”, which gives us an excuse for withdrawal if they cannot perform the impossible.”</p>
<p>Gilmore and Lugar also appear to be on the same page in their efforts to refocus America’s efforts in Iraq.  And Gilmore said today he hoped that other key Republicans would join with them in that effort.</p>
<p>Lugar’s proposal today said, “First, we have an interest in preventing Iraq or any piece of its territory from being used as a safe haven or training ground for terrorists or as a repository or assembly point for weapons of mass destruction.  Second, we have an interest in preventing the disorder and sectarian violence in Iraq from upsetting wider regional stability. Third, we have an interest in preventing Iranian domination of the region. The fall of Saddam Hussein’s Sunni government opened up opportunities for Iran to seek much greater influence in Iraq and in the broader Middle East. Fourth, we have an interest in limiting the loss of U.S. credibility in the region and throughout the world as a result of our Iraq mission.”</p>
<p>Like Gilmore, Lugar called for “a downsizing and re-deployment of U.S. military forces to more sustainable positions in Iraq or the Middle East. “</p>
<p>Gilmore’s letter to Bush last week said, “The U.S. has a stake in preventing a government from emerging that is expressly hostile to the U.S., such as in an al-Qaeda inspired coup.  The U.S. has a stake in not permitting the invasion and occupation of Iraq by any of its neighbors. I believe the only realistic alternative &#8212; the least bad option, if you will &#8212; is a limited deliberate drawdown of our military men and women and a redeployment of the forces remaining in the region to areas where they can more efficiently and effectively carry out a clearly defined mission.”</p>

					<p>Gov. Jim Gilmore has written an op-ed on the topic of property rights in <a href="article.php?id=21270">Human Events</a>, make sure to read the article and learn more about Gov. Gilmore&#8217;s National Property Rights Initiative at <a href="../mygilmoresite/Property%20Rights">MyGilmore</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Two years ago this week, the United States Supreme Court eroded our Fifth Amendment protections in the Kelo v. City of New London case by decreeing that government could seize your home to hand it over to private developers.</p>
<p>This was judicial activism at its worst. The Supreme Court essentially reworded the Constitution, making property rights conditional: a citizen had a right to his property only so long as he put it to use in a way the government deemed of economic value.<br />
As a lifelong conservative, I was offended by such an egregious judicial overreach. As a candidate for President, I believe it is past time for the federal government to step forward in defense of these cherished liberties in a manner our Founding Fathers would be proud of.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers recognized that property rights were the foundation of a free society. The Virginia Declaration of Rights included property rights among the “inherent rights” of man. James Madison went so far as to define property as including not only a citizen’s possessions, but his opinions, religion, liberty and safety. It is no surprise, then, that the Founding Fathers enshrined the right to private property in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. As the Fifth Amendment guarantees, private property should be taken only for a &#8220;public use,&#8221; such as a school or road, not to build a private office building or garage The owner of that property, even when taken for public use, is entitled to just compensation.</p></blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal">The President’s Committee and the Ministry of Culture discussed cultural activities in each of our respective countries, and these discussions were underscored by events presented at on-site locations representing the diverse facets of Chinese culture, both ancient and traditional and modern.<span>  </span>Our visits included the <st1:placename w:st="on">Shanghai</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Museum</st1:placetype> and the Shanghai Children’s Palace; the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum and the newly opened Han Yang Ling Tombs in Xian; the Commune at the Great Wall architectural development, <st1:placetype w:st="on">Palace</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Museum</st1:placetype>, the National Museum of Art, and a hard-hat tour of the new <st1:placename w:st="on">National</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Center</st1:placetype> for the Performing Arts in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Beijing</st1:place></st1:city>.<o:p> </o:p></p>

				<small>June 19th, 2007 <!-- by Gilmore for President --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>WASHINGTON – Bloggers across the nation have hailed former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore’s announcement of a National Property Rights Initiative.  Gilmore unveiled the proposal last weekend at the National Taxpayers Union conference in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>“A candidate who gets it!  People keep asking me why I’m so high on Governor Gilmore and this is just another reason,” said blogger Wendell Robinson of Ohio.  “Kudos to the Governor for an initiative that gets to the heart and soul of what America is all about.”</p>
<p>In Iowa, Don McDowell of Cyclone Conservatives posted, “This happens to be an issue that I personally care a whole lot about and am very pleased to see that Governor Jim Gilmore is using whatever size bullhorn he has to try to make it a part of the public policy debate.”  Volokh Conspiracy, a blog on legal issues, said, “In general, his program looks pretty interesting and sensible…”</p>
<p>Gilmore’s National Property Rights Initiative includes a commitment to appoint judges who will strictly interpret the Constitution, as well as reissuing President Reagan’s Executive Order 12630, which required federal agencies to “first do no harm” to property rights when writing regulations.  Gilmore would also charge a Special Assistant in the White House with coordinating federal protections of property rights.</p>

					<p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
<p>As you know from my public statements, I have supported your increase in troops in Iraq, in the belief that a new initiative was necessary to bring the Iraqi war to a successful conclusion.  It has been my position that this troop increase should be given an opportunity to work.  Increasingly, however, reports show that attacks on our troops, Iraqi police and civilians are not abating.</p>

					<p>Governor Gilmore participated in an online chat with readers of the Rocky Mountain News today. The following is a complete transcript of the chat, courtesy of the <a href="../denver/rockytalklive/archives/2007/06/gop_presidential_candidate_jim.html">Rocky Mountain News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, took questions about his campaign.</p>
<p>drnevins(Q) I think the best thing that has been said by Jim Gilmore is that the other candidates do not reflect conservative values.<br />
Gov._Jim_Gilmore(A) Thanks for joining us today. I have made it clear from the beginning of this campaign that a conservative candidacy is needed. The three leading candidates, who I have described as &#8220;Rudy McRomney,&#8221; are all distinguished leaders but they are not conservatives. Other candidates in the race, in fact, are conservative in many ways. But several of them have been weak on tax increases, immigration issues, and the war on terrorism. I have offered myself as a consistent conservative with a long track record of leading and governing as a conservative. I believe this is best for the Republican Party and for the people of the United States.</p></blockquote>
