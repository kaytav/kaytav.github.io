										<div class="title"> Stopping Illegal Immigration</div>
										<div class="subtext">
											Jim Gilmore is, as are most Americans, a descendent of immigrants who came to this country legally to seek the American dream. And, he believes that dream should remain attainable for those who obey the law. However, there should be no amnesty for those who are in our country illegally. As a forceful advocate for homeland security, Jim Gilmore knows that we must secure America's borders to protect our country. We will not be able to deal successfully with those who are in our country illegally until we have secured our borders and stopped the entrance of additional illegals. We must re-examine our existing immigration laws and develop a better program for temporary workers as well as requiring employers to verify workers are here legally.

As President, Jim Gilmore will launch a national energy independence project called American Energy Freedom, a NASA like effort to motivate and stimulate American ingenuity and technology using research and development tax incentives to help free our nation from its dependence on foreign oil within 25 years.  In the meantime, Jim Gilmore will push for steady and dramatic increases in domestic energy production and an increase in the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Jim Gilmore also will support expanding our use of alternative fuels like ethanol, making dramatic improvements in battery technology for plug-in hybrid vehicles and the long-range development of hydrogen power for vehicles
