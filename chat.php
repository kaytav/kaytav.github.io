How do you respond to the announcement by House Democrats, that they&#039;ll attempt to change House rules, in order to pass tax hikes, without a vote? </p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">I'm glad to be here tonight with my fellow bloggers and citizens to answer questions about the future of the country.  To begin, I oppose the Democrats' chaning House rules in order to pass tax hikes.  In fact, the backbone of my political life has been in cutting taxes.  When I ran for Governor of Virginia I ran on an anti-tax program.  After I was elected, I carried through, kept my word, and year after year reduced taxes on behalf of the people of Virginia. Therefore, I would oppose the Democrats' attempt to raise taxes with or without a vote.</p>

									<p class="content">As a former Governor, I believe the primary duty of education rests with the states.  I also believe that to empower people, they must have a good opportunity for education.  It's not just the courses now offered.  We have to teach a culture of independence and entrepreneurship.  As Governor, I was a supporter of public education, but I also supported other alternatives.  I supported home schoolers.  I was the author of Virginia's first charter school law, and even supported private school choices.  The President can emphasize education, and I will do so as part of a conservative program of empowerment.</p>

									<p class="who">submitted by DCA</p>
									<p class="content">Governor Gilmore - Great job last night!  It is about time that the hypocrisy of your opponents is exposed.  If you had been given the chance, what would you have said to Ron Paul concerning his &quot;it&#039;s our fault&quot; comment?</p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">Last night at the debate, I certainly was not trying to be disrepectful of my opponents.  However, I believe the American people should be informed as to the records of each candidate.  The press and moderators could not be counted on to expose any record.  Candidates should not be able to simply assert that they are conservatives even though their records are not conservative at all.  Regarding the War on Terror, I certainly don't believe "it's our fault."  I was the Governor of Virginia during the 9/11 attack and I lost a friend, Barbara Olson on the Pentagon plane.  I believe we must be relentless in combating these fundamentalist terrorists.  We cannot reason with them.  I do believe we can more strongly assert the moral righteousness of America and gain more friends and allies across the world.  We must draw the people of the world to America by letting them know, like in the Cold War, that we have liberty and well-being for the world at heart.</p>

Supporters of the 2nd Amendment do trust the American people.</p>

									<p class="what">Question:</p>
									<p class="who">submitted by Michelle McDonald</p>
									<p class="content">Governor Gilmore,  I watched the debate last night and had hoped to hear more about the Fair Tax, especially since there was a huge fair tax rally going on in the same town at the same time as the debate.  However, only Gov. Huckabee even mentioned it.  What is your stance on the Fair Tax?</p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">I support tax simplification.  I am frustrated with the tax system that seeks to direct peoples' conduct through the tax code.  My primary focus is now and has been controlling government spending to enable tax cuts for regular people.  When people get to keep more of their own money they are empowered to determine their own lives.  The Fair Tax is a consumption tax meant to replace all other taxes.  Before adopting the Fair Tax, we must ensure that the Fair Tax doesn't become a mere add-on to other taxes.  If you have any hope of tax simplification and reduction, you must choose a candidate with a clear track record of cutting taxes, not simply raising taxes every time a demand is placed upon a state or a local government.  I ask you to look at the record of each person claiming to be a tax cutter, and then I believe you will support me.</p>

Where do you stand on property rights?</p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">Mary, I am a strong supporter of property rights.  I don't think it's right for a government to be able to come in and take property solely to increase the tax value of that property.  As such, I oppose the Kelo v. New London decision.  The certainty of being able to own and pass down your own property is an element of American liberty.  Naturally, we take property all the time under the Constitution with just compensation, but we should not enable governments to take property on the basis of simply trying to get more revenue.</p>

									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">I chaired the National Commission on Terrorism and Homeland Security for the United States government from 1999 through 2003.  Those reports can be found on the Rand Corporation webpage (www.rand.org).  When their webpage comes up, type "Gilmore Commission" into the search window and you can see the reports.  This country has the best chance to survive and handle a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, preserving our liberties, if we create a complete community of preparedness.  We have to have a total partnership between federal, state and local authorities, the corporat community and community leadership.  We have to have a 72-hour response plan everywhere in America so that everyone knows their role in the event of an attack.  Once we are prepared, we can say to the American people that any attack is something we can deal with.  Thsi will reduce the danger that we will overreact and take away liberties in the face of a terrorist attack.</p>

									<p class="what">Question:</p>
									<p class="who">submitted by Lisa</p>
									<p class="content">Governor Gilmore,

Please clarify your stance on abortion. Do you believe that abortion is wrong and why? Do you believe that an infant in the womb is a human person from conception? Why do you believe women should retain the right to abort their kids till 12 weeks?</p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">Lisa, my convictions on abortion are deeply felt and have never changed.  I have always said the same thing, and I shouldn't change now just to win additional votes.  I believe that after a period of about 8 weeks (not 12 weeks) there shouldn't be any more abortions, except to save the life of the mother if she is in danger during childbirth.  I am pro-life, and I believe I have the best record of any candidate in this race.  During my time as Governor, we passed a 24-hour waiting period, informed consent, parental notification, and I signed the partial birth abortion ban.  I intervened in a case similar to the Schiavo case, just to be sure that justice was being done to the injured person.  Sadly, that became a political football with much misleading information and attacks on me in the press.  I also authored Virginia's anti-cloning bill because I was concerned that technology and medicine was outrunning ethics.</p>

How do you think our government needs to respond to the threat from Iran?</p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">I answered this question in the debate last night.  I would like to join with the nations of the world in a clear statement that Iran should not have nuclear weapons.  This should result in serious sanctions that express the international opinion regarding this issue.  The burden is on Iran to demosntrate that they are a responsible member of the community of nations and can responsibly have such power.  This they have not done.  If international pressur e does not work, we must from the beginning of the next presidential administration begin to have a national conversation with the American people regarding this threat.  We must rally the American people behind any tough action that Iran may force the international community to take to disable or eliminate a nuclear weapons program.  As part of that debate, we should think about the reaction in the Middle East itself to Iran getting nuclear weapons.  Would that result in Saudi Arabia seeking a nuclear weapon?  Wheere would Saudi Arabia get such a weapon? From Pakistan? What effect would this have on the Israelis or Turkey?  We simply have to explain to the American people the danger of nuclear proliferation in such an unstable area as the Middle East.</p>

									<p class="what">Question:</p>
									<p class="who">submitted by Lanny</p>
									<p class="content">Personally I believe we should close our borders, North and South by force if necessary.  For those who have disregarded our laws?  Enforce them as you would if I don&#039;t pay my taxes, which is another sore issue.   What will you do about immigration?</p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">Lanny, regarding immigration, I believe the American people are angry because they are expected to obey the law, and we seem to imply that people who enter the United States illegally should just receive an amnesty.  I believe the right policy is to secure our borders, be tough on employers who hire illegal aliens, have no amnesty, and no path to citizenship.  It is a tough question on how to deal with the shadowy 12 million illegal immigratns who are already here.  This is the result of ignoring this issue for so long.  I believe we must offer a period of time for illegal immigrants to come in and register or they will have to be returned home.  We can have an immigration reform up the road, but we have not yet had a decent policy discussion on what kind of immigration America needs to run our economy.  Finally, there are reports that Hezbollah has developed a training camp in South America.  Unsecure borders is not just an immigration issue, but a national security issue.  As former chairman of the "Gilmore Commission," I began to issue this warning as early as 1999.</p>

									<p class="what">Question:</p>
									<p class="who">submitted by Anonymous</p>
									<p class="content">In the debate last night you were asked about the role of women and minorities in the Republican Party. More importantly, can you elaborate on the efforts you made to broaden the role of women and minorities in public service during your time as Governor? </p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">First, you have to win trust and I think I did this as Governor and before as Attorney General.  As Attorney General, I led other AGs from across the South to stop the burning of African-American churches.  As Governor, I gave extra support to the traditional African-American universities, which were not receiving equal treatment in my view.  My cabinet included two women and two African-Americans, all highly capable people.  Capable women were included throughout the agencies.  As Attorney General, I worked with dozens of women attorneys.  It was a great experience.  As Commonwealth's Attorney, my first attorney hired was a woman, who is today a judge.  As Governor, I had the opportunity to appoint to judges, one of whom was black, and the other was a woman, both of whom still serve today with distinction.  As chairman of the Republican National Committee, I appointed a hispanic member to the executive committee of the RNC.  A second appointment to the executive committee was a distinguished African-American, Michael Steele, who later became Lieutenant Governor of Maryland.  Any public leader must appoint excellent people and they can be found from all groups.</p>

									<p class="content">I consider 1984 to be one of the great works of conservatism.  I have not read Fahrenheit 451 or Brave New World, but I saw the movies.  I also recommend "Blade Runner" and "Minority Report."</p>

									<p class="content">Sir, you served with my father, John Beaudrie in Germany.  Being in the military myself, my question for you is, As our Commander in Chief, how would you handle our current situation in Iraq as far as, should we stay or should we withdrawal our forces?
</p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">I remember your father very well.  He and I went out one afternoon and fired a .45 automatic for pistol training.  I think we didn't use earplugs.  Please give your father my very best and I hope that he will call the campaign office and say hello.  I bring the experience of a veteran to foreign policy issues.  I know what soldiers go through.  It would be so easy just to pull our troops out as the Democrats suggest, but we have to face the fact that the risk is extremely high, that major conflict would occur with potential intervention from other countries, igniting a major war.  This would be very dangerous to our country.  I therefore reject the Democrats' timetable for withdrawl.  The Democrats are not acting in America's national interest.  However, we "stood pat" too long, and I believe that was the message of the last election.  We have to apply every resource and method to try to bring stability to this country we have disrupted.  Otherwise, we'll be right back where we started.</p>

									<p class="content">What did you major in at the University of Virginia?</p>
									<p class="what">Answer:</p>
									<p class="who">from Jim Gilmore</p>
									<p class="content">Red, I majored in foreign affairs at UVA.  I specialized in Russian studies, but took courses in every area of the world, including economics courses.  This is why I have spent my life developing expertise in international relations.  This is why I accepted the request from the United States Government to chair the National Commission on Terrorism and Homeland Security. 

We've been blogging now for an hour, and I have to go.  We stil lhave dozens of questions we can't get to.  I sincerely appreciate people coming online to talk with me.  I ask for your support.  Please send us your email addresses and those of all your friends who might support us.  Your financial contributions at any level are greatly appreciated.  You can donate through the website.  Thanks again, Jim Gilmore.</p>

									<p class="content">Governor Gilmore's statement on Rev. Falwell. 

In the passing of Rev. Jerry Falwell, we have lost someone who brought inspiration and faith to millions of people around the world. Dr. Falwell was a valued supporter of mine for many years and I was an admirer of his good works. The educational institution he founded, Liberty University, has become a major employer in Virginia and is well regarded by educators from throughout the country. Not only did he inspire people in Virginia and America with his faith based efforts to improve and lift up the lives of our citizens, he also has helped people throughout the world with his mission work. We will miss him.</p>
